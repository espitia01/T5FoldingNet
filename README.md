# T5FoldingNet

Currently the model is limited as it only has been trained for one epoch in a dataset that samples the conformal space for proteins of length 4 - 8. 

The notebook requires some files not hosted here to run properly. These can be accessed <a href="https://console.paperspace.com/tnj3viogvt/notebook/rmxfpdja9epzk2e">here.</a> 

### Currently Working On

<ol>
  <li>Generating a dataset that samples the space of longer sequences</li>
  <li>Further fine tune the model on the generated dataset</li>
  <li>Evaluate its performance relative and implement postprocessing on the output if necessary</li>
  <li>Compare to existing models.</li>
</ol>
